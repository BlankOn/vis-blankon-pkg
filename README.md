Ubuntu Repository - Total Packages and Sizes
============================================

This Git repository contains scripts I use to gather and visualize the Ubuntu
repositories in terms of total packages and their total size.

Check the GitHub page for the result - <http://fajran.github.io/vis-ubuntu-pkg>.

How?
----

I took the package index files (a.k.a. `Packages` file) and counted the number
of packages inside. I also summed the size of each packages to get the size of
the repository. The files are from the "at-release" repository which means I
excluded the `-updates` and `-security` repositories. The at-release repository
is presumably frozen and therefore the size wonâ€™t change anymore, where the
latest two repositories are for the updates, which by definition are always
updated.  Well.. except when the release is not supported anymore.

How To Run?
-----------

First, adjust the list of repositories, archive urls, etc in the `config.py` file.

    $ vi config.py

Then, download all index files

    $ python download.py

By default, all indices will be downloaded into `data/` directory.

After that, run the analysis script to collect all numbers from the index
files. Put the result into a file so we don't need to do this again.

    $ python analyze.py > out/raw-data.json

Once it's ready, run the visualization script to create codes needed to make
charts using Google Chart API.

    $ python visualize.py out/raw-data.json > out/data.js

Finally, open the HTML page I made to show the data.

    $ xdg-open index.html
