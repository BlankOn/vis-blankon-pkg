Ubuntu Repository - Total Packages and Sizes
============================================

This Git repository contains scripts I use to gather and visualize the Ubuntu
repositories in terms of total packages and their total size.

Check the GitHub page for the result - <http://fajran.github.ioo/vis-ubuntu-pkg>.

[How?](http://fajran.web.id/2013/05/ubuntu-repository-total-packages-and-sizes.html)
----

I took the package index files (a.k.a. `Packages` file) and counted the number
of packages inside. I also summed the size of each packages to get the size of
the repository. The files are from the "at-release" repository which means I
excluded the `-updates` and `-security` repositories. The at-release repository
is presumably frozen and therefore the size wonâ€™t change anymore, where the
latest two repositories are for the updates, which by definition are always
updated.  Well.. except when the release is not supported anymore.
